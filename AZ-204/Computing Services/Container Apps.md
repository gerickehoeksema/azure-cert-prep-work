## Introduction to Azure Container Apps

### üîç What is Azure Container Apps?

Azure Container Apps is a fully managed serverless container service that enables you to run microservices and containerized applications on a serverless platform. Container Apps handles infrastructure management, providing a modern application platform built on Kubernetes and open-source technologies like KEDA, Dapr, and Envoy.

### üåü Key Benefits

- **Serverless containers** - No need to manage VMs or orchestration
- **Microservices support** - Built for cloud-native architectures
- **Auto-scaling** - Scale to zero and scale based on HTTP traffic, events, or custom metrics
- **Revision management** - Easy rollbacks and blue/green deployments
- **Service discovery** - Built-in service-to-service communication

### üí° Exam Tip

> For the AZ-204 exam, understand the distinction between Azure Container Apps, Azure Container Instances (ACI), and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Container Apps sits between ACI (for simpler scenarios) and AKS (for complex, full control scenarios).

---

## Core Concepts

### üì¶ Container Apps Environments

A Container Apps environment is a secure boundary where container apps are deployed. It provides:

- Shared virtual network
- Log Analytics workspace integration
- Managed Dapr integration
- Shared configuration among container apps

```csharp
// C# code to create a Container Apps environment
var environment = new ContainerAppsEnvironmentData(location)
{
    AppLogsConfiguration = new LogAnalyticsConfigurationData()
    {
        CustomerId = logAnalyticsWorkspaceId,
        SharedKey = logAnalyticsSharedKey
    }
};

var createdEnvironment = await client.ContainerAppsEnvironments.CreateOrUpdateAsync(
    resourceGroupName,
    environmentName,
    environment);
```

### üîÑ Revisions

Revisions represent immutable snapshots of your container app. Key features:

- Enables blue/green and canary deployments
- Allows multiple revisions to be active simultaneously
- Supports traffic splitting between revisions

```bash
# Create a new revision with az CLI
az containerapp revision create \
  --name myapp \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --container-name mycontainer \
  --image mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/containerapps-helloworld:latest
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Gotcha

> Revisions are immutable! You can't update an existing revision. When you update app settings, container image, or other configurations, a new revision is created.

### üîå Dapr Integration

Container Apps provides built-in support for Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime):

- Service-to-service communication
- State management
- Pub/sub messaging
- Input and output bindings
- Distributed tracing

```yaml
# Enabling Dapr in container app YAML
properties:
  managedEnvironmentId: /subscriptions/.../managedEnvironments/my-environment
  configuration:
    dapr:
      enabled: true
      appId: "myapp"
      appPort: 80
```

### üí° Exam Tip

> The exam often tests understanding of how to enable and configure Dapr components in Container Apps. Remember that Dapr components are configured at the environment level, not per container app.

---

## Authentication and Authorization

### üîê Authentication Providers

Container Apps supports several authentication providers:

- Microsoft Identity Platform (Azure AD)
- GitHub
- Facebook
- Google
- Twitter
- OpenID Connect

### üõ°Ô∏è Authorization

Two main authorization approaches:

1. **Allow all authenticated users** - Any authenticated user can access your app
2. **Require specific roles** - Only users with specific roles can access your app

```csharp
// C# configuration for auth
var authSettings = new ContainerAppAuthSettings()
{
    Platform = new ContainerAppAuthPlatform() { Enabled = true },
    GlobalValidation = new ContainerAppAuthGlobalValidation() { UnauthenticatedClientAction = "RedirectToLoginPage" },
    IdentityProviders = new ContainerAppIdentityProviders() 
    { 
        AzureActiveDirectory = new ContainerAppAadProvider() 
        { 
            Enabled = true, 
            Registration = new ContainerAppAadRegistration() 
            { 
                ClientId = "<client-id>", 
                ClientSecretSettingName = "MICROSOFT_PROVIDER_AUTHENTICATION_SECRET",
                OpenIdIssuer = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/v2.0" 
            } 
        } 
    }
};
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Gotcha

> When configuring auth for Container Apps, remember that it's applied at the ingress level, not per container. If you have multiple containers in your app, all share the same auth configuration.

---

## Scaling and Performance

### üìà Scaling Rules

Container Apps can scale based on:

- **HTTP traffic**: Scale based on concurrent requests
- **Events**: Scale based on event-driven workloads using KEDA
- **Custom metrics**: Scale based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics

```yaml
# HTTP scaling rule
scale:
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  rules:
  - name: http-rule
    http:
      metadata:
        concurrentRequests: "100"
```

```yaml
# Custom KEDA scaling rule (example for Azure Service Bus)
scale:
  minReplicas: 0
  maxReplicas: 10
  rules:
  - name: service-bus-rule
    custom:
      type: azure-servicebus
      metadata:
        queueName: myqueue
        messageCount: "100"
```

### üîÑ Scale to Zero

Container Apps can scale to zero instances when there's no traffic, which means:

- No compute costs when your app is idle
- Automatic activation when traffic arrives
- Potential cold start latency

### üí° Exam Tip

> The exam will likely test your knowledge of different scaling behaviors. Remember that HTTP-based apps can scale to zero by default, but may have cold start issues. For mission-critical applications, set `minReplicas` to at least 1.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Gotcha

> When scaling to zero, your app will experience a cold start delay when traffic resumes. This can range from a few seconds to over a minute depending on container size and complexity.

---

## Networking

### üîÄ Ingress

Container Apps ingress controls how HTTP traffic reaches your application:

- External ingress: Exposes your app to the internet with a public endpoint
- Internal ingress: Makes your app available only within the environment's virtual network
- No ingress: No HTTP endpoint is exposed (useful for background processing)

```yaml
# Ingress configuration
ingress:
  external: true
  targetPort: 80
  traffic:
  - latestRevision: true
    weight: 100
  transport: auto
```

### üåê Virtual Network Integration

Container Apps can be integrated with virtual networks:

- Inject container apps environment into a custom VNet subnet
- Access resources in peered networks
- Use private endpoints for secure service connections

```bash
# Create a Container Apps environment with VNet integration
az containerapp env create \
  --name my-environment \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --infrastructure-subnet-resource-id /subscriptions/...
```

### üí° Exam Tip

> For the exam, remember that Container Apps environments can only be injected into empty subnets, and the subnet must have a minimum size of /23 (512 IPs).

---

## Monitoring and Logging

### üìä Log Analytics Integration

Container Apps integrates with Log Analytics for monitoring and logging:

- System logs from the environment
- Container console logs from your application
- Application Insights integration

### üìù View log streams in Azure Container Apps

- [System logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/logging#system-logs) from the Container Apps environment and your container app.
- Container [console logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/logging#container-console-logs) from your container app. Log streams are accessible through the Azure portal or the Azure CLI.

### üìù View log streams via the Azure CLI

You can view your container app's log streams from the Azure CLI with the `az containerapp logs show` command or your container app's environment system log stream with the `az containerapp env logs show` command.

Control the log stream with the following arguments:

- `--tail` (Default) View the last n log messages. Values are 0-300 messages. The default is 20.
- `--follow` View a continuous live stream of the log messages.

### üìù Stream Container app logs

You can stream the system or console logs for your container app. To stream the container app system logs, use the `--type` argument with the value `system`. To stream the container console logs, use the `--type` argument with the value `console`. The default is `console`.

#### View container app system log stream

This example uses the `--tail` argument to display the last 50 system log messages from the container app.

```bash
az containerapp logs show 
	--name <CONTAINER_APP_NAME> 
	--resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> 
	--type system 
	--tail 50
```

This example displays a continuous live stream of system log messages from the container app using the `--follow` argument

```bash
az containerapp logs show 
	--name <CONTAINER_APP_NAME> 
	--resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> 
	--type system 
	--follow
```

### üìù View container console log stream

To connect to a container's console log stream in a container app with multiple revisions, replicas, and containers, include the following parameters in the `az containerapp logs show` command.

|Argument|Description|
|---|---|
|`--revision`|The revision name.|
|`--replica`|The replica name in the revision.|
|`--container`|The container name to connect to.|

```bash
az containerapp revision list 
	--name <CONTAINER_APP_NAME> 
	--resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> 
	--query "[].name"
```

Use the `az containerapp replica list` command to get the replica and container names.

```bash
az containerapp replica list 
	--name <CONTAINER_APP_NAME> 
	--resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> 
	--revision <REVISION_NAME> 
	--query "[].{Containers:properties.containers[].name, Name:name}"
```

Live stream the container console using the `az container app logs show` command with the `--follow` argument

```bash
az containerapp logs show 
	--name <CONTAINER_APP_NAME> 
	--resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> 
	--revision <REVISION_NAME> 
	--replica <REPLICA_NAME> 
	--container <CONTAINER_NAME> 
	--type console 
	--follow
```

View the last 50 console log messages using the `az containerapp logs show` command with the `--tail` argument.

```bash
az containerapp logs show 
	--name <CONTAINER_APP_NAME> 
	--resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> 
	--revision <REVISION_NAME> 
	--replica <REPLICA_NAME> 
	--container <CONTAINER_NAME> 
	--type console 
	--tail 50
```

### üìù View environment system log stream

```bash
az containerapp env logs show 
	--name <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> 
	--resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> 
	--follow
```

### üìä Application Insights

For more detailed application monitoring:

```csharp
// Add Application Insights to your Container App
var appInsightsComp = new ComponentsResource(
    new ResourceIdentifier($"/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Insights/components/{appInsightsName}"),
    AzureLocation.WestUS,
    new ComponentsResourceData(ComponentsType.Web)
    {
        ApplicationType = ApplicationType.Web,
        FlowType = FlowType.Bluefield
    });

// Create container app with Application Insights
var containerApp = new ContainerAppResource(
    resourceGroupName,
    containerAppName,
    new ContainerAppData(location)
    {
        ManagedEnvironmentId = containerAppEnvironment.Id,
        Configuration = new Configuration()
        {
            Ingress = new Ingress()
            {
                External = true,
                TargetPort = 80
            },
            Secrets = 
            {
                new Secret()
                {
                    Name = "appinsights-cs",
                    Value = appInsightsComp.Properties.ConnectionString
                }
            }
        }
        // Add container configuration with env variables for AppInsights
    }
);
```

### üí° Exam Tip

> For the exam, understand how to query logs using Kusto Query Language (KQL). You might need to interpret log queries to troubleshoot Container Apps issues.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Gotcha

> Container Apps logs are written to the Log Analytics workspace associated with your environment. If you delete your environment, you'll lose access to historical logs unless you've set up log retention policies.

---

## CI/CD and Deployment

### üöÄ Deployment Options

Multiple ways to deploy to Container Apps:

- **Azure CLI:** Quick deployments and automation scripts
- **Azure Portal:** Visual interface for management
- **ARM/Bicep Templates:** Infrastructure as code
- **GitHub Actions:** CI/CD integration
- **Azure DevOps Pipelines:** Enterprise CI/CD

### üì¶ GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow for Container Apps
name: Build and deploy to Azure Container Apps

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Log in to Azure
      uses: azure/login@v1
      with:
        creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
        
    - name: Build and push container image
      uses: azure/docker-login@v1
      with:
        login-server: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_LOGIN_SERVER }}
        username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
        
    - run: |
        docker build . -t ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_LOGIN_SERVER }}/myapp:${{ github.sha }}
        docker push ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_LOGIN_SERVER }}/myapp:${{ github.sha }}
        
    - name: Deploy to Azure Container Apps
      uses: azure/CLI@v1
      with:
        inlineScript: |
          az config set extension.use_dynamic_install=yes_without_prompt
          az containerapp update \
            --name myapp \
            --resource-group myResourceGroup \
            --image ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_LOGIN_SERVER }}/myapp:${{ github.sha }}
```

### üí° Exam Tip

> For the exam, know how to set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps. Focus on understanding how to securely store and use credentials and secrets in your pipeline.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Gotcha

> When setting up CI/CD for Container Apps, remember that each deployment creates a new revision. You may want to implement a cleanup strategy to avoid accumulating too many revisions.

## Integration with Other Azure Services

### üîÑ Azure Key Vault Integration

Securely manage secrets using Key Vault:

```csharp
// C# code to integrate Key Vault with Container Apps
var containerApp = new ContainerAppData(location)
{
    ManagedEnvironmentId = environment.Id,
    Configuration = new Configuration()
    {
        Secrets = 
        {
            new Secret()
            {
                Name = "keyvault-secret",
                Value = "@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=https://myvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/mysecret/)"
            }
        }
    },
    Template = new Template()
    {
        Containers = 
        {
            new Container()
            {
                Name = "mycontainer",
                Image = "mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/containerapps-helloworld:latest",
                Env = 
                {
                    new EnvironmentVar() { Name = "SECRET_VALUE", SecretRef = "keyvault-secret" }
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
```

### üì± Event-Driven Integration

Container Apps can integrate with event-driven Azure services:

- Azure Service Bus
- Azure Event Grid
- Azure Event Hubs
- Azure Storage Queues

```yaml
# KEDA scaling based on Azure Service Bus
scale:
  minReplicas: 0
  maxReplicas: 10
  rules:
  - name: service-bus-scale
    custom:
      type: azure-servicebus
      metadata:
        queueName: myqueue
        messageCount: "100"
        connectionFromEnv: SERVICEBUS_CONNECTION_STRING
```

### üí° Exam Tip

> For the exam, understand how Container Apps can be triggered by events from other Azure services. Know how to configure KEDA scalers for different event sources.
