## 🚀 Introduction to Azure Functions

Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that enables you to run code on-demand without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure.

### Key Concepts:
- **Serverless Compute**: Pay only for the time your code runs
- **Event-driven architecture**: Functions execute in response to events
- **Microservice approach**: Build small, single-purpose functions

### 💡 Exam Tip:
> Know the difference between Functions, Logic Apps, and WebJobs. Focus on when to use each one based on scenarios presented in the exam.

## 🔧 Function Fundamentals

### Function Apps
- A function app provides the execution context for your functions
- Multiple functions can share the same function app, scaling together
- Functions within the same function app share resources, configuration, and connections

### Runtime Versions
- **Azure Functions 1.x**: .NET Framework 4.7
- **Azure Functions 2.x**: .NET Core 2.2
- **Azure Functions 3.x**: .NET Core 3.1
- **Azure Functions 4.x**: .NET 6.0, isolated worker process model
- **Azure Functions 5.x**: .NET 8.0

### Hosting Plans
1. **Consumption Plan**:
   - Automatic scaling
   - Pay-per-execution billing
   - 5-minute timeout by default
   - 1.5GB memory limit
   - Dynamic scaling based on workload

2. **Premium Plan**:
   - Pre-warmed instances for no cold starts
   - Unlimited execution duration
   - Higher memory instances (up to 14GB)
   - VNet connectivity
   - More predictable pricing

3. **App Service Plan**:
   - Run on dedicated VMs
   - No timeout restrictions
   - Maximum memory based on plan size
   - Always running (even when idle)

4. **Kubernetes/Container**:
   - KEDA-based scaling (Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling)
   - Run on AKS or any Kubernetes cluster

### 💡 Exam Tip:
> Memorize the limits and features of each plan. The exam loves to present scenarios where you need to recommend the appropriate hosting plan based on specific requirements.

### ⚠️ Gotcha:
> The Consumption plan has a default timeout of 5 minutes, but can be configured up to 10 minutes. Premium and App Service plans can run for unlimited time.

## 🔄 Triggers and Bindings

### Triggers
Triggers define how a function is invoked. Each function must have exactly one trigger.

#### Common Triggers:
- **HTTP**: REST API calls
- **Timer**: Time-based triggers using CRON expressions
- **Blob Storage**: When a blob is added/updated
- **Queue Storage**: Process Azure Storage queue messages
- **Event Hub**: Process event streams
- **Service Bus**: Process Service Bus messages
- **Cosmos DB**: React to Cosmos DB changes
- **Event Grid**: Event Grid events or webhooks

### Bindings
Bindings connect your function to other resources without writing connection code.

#### Types of Bindings:
- **Input Bindings**: Read data from a service
- **Output Bindings**: Write data to a service

#### Common Bindings:
- Blob Storage
- Cosmos DB
- Event Hub
- Event Grid
- Queue Storage
- Service Bus
- Table Storage
- SendGrid (email)
- Twilio (SMS)

### Binding Expressions
- Use binding expressions to reference other bindings, environment variables, or function parameters
- Syntax: `{name}`
- Examples:
  - `{queueTrigger}` - References queue message content
  - `{sys.randGuid}` - Generates a random GUID

### 💡 Exam Tip:
> Know how to configure different types of triggers and bindings in both host.json and function.json files. Also understand the differences between input and output bindings.

### ⚠️ Gotcha:
> Remember that Event Grid and Event Hub are different services. Event Grid is for discrete events, while Event Hub is for high-throughput event streams. The exam often tries to confuse these.

## 🖥️ Function Development Options

### Languages Supported:
- C# (compiled and script)
- F#
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- PowerShell
- Python
- Java

### Development Environments:
1. **Azure Portal**:
   - In-browser development experience
   - Limited testing capabilities
   - No source control integration

2. **Local Development**:
   - Visual Studio or VS Code with Azure Functions Core Tools
   - Local debugging
   - Extensions for productivity

3. **Command Line**:
   - Azure Functions Core Tools
   - Cross-platform CLI tools
   - Automation friendly

### Function Project Structure:
- **host.json**: Configures the function app
- **local.settings.json**: Local settings and connection strings (local dev only)
- **function.json**: Configuration for individual functions (triggers, bindings)
- **function-name/**: Folder containing function code and configuration

### C# Development Approaches:
1. **C# Class Library** (compiled):
   - Uses class and method attributes for triggers/bindings
   - Fully typed binding parameters
   - Compiled as DLL

2. **C# Script**:
   - Uses function.json for configuration
   - File extension: .csx
   - Interpreted at runtime

### 💡 Exam Tip:
> For C# developers, know both class library and script approaches. The exam may ask about differences between these implementation styles and when to use each.

### ⚠️ Gotcha:
> Understand that the .NET isolated worker process model differs from the in-process model, especially regarding binding implementations. Isolated worker uses different binding attributes and patterns.

## 📦 Deployment and CI/CD

### Deployment Methods:
1. **Zip Deployment**:
   - Package and deploy function code as a zip
   - `az functionapp deployment source config-zip`
   - Support for run-from-package (read-only)

2. **GitHub Actions**:
   - CI/CD integration with GitHub
   - Automated workflow on push/PR

3. **Azure DevOps Pipelines**:
   - Full CI/CD pipeline support
   - Test, build, and deploy

4. **Docker Containers**:
   - Package functions as containers
   - Deploy to Premium, App Service, or Kubernetes plans

### Deployment Slots:
- Test in a staging environment
- Swap slots for zero-downtime deployments
- Each slot has its own configuration

### Application Settings:
- Environment variables accessible to functions
- Connection strings and secrets
- Available in Azure Portal or via Azure CLI

### 💡 Exam Tip:
> Know the difference between WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE=1 and WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE=[URL]. One runs from a local package, the other from a URL.

### ⚠️ Gotcha:
> Deployment slots are only available in Premium and App Service plans, not in Consumption plans.

## 📈 Scaling and Performance

### Consumption Plan Scaling:
- Scale based on event rate (queue messages, HTTP requests)
- Scale to zero when idle
- Scale controlled by the scale controller
- Scale limit: 200 instances per function app

### Scale Units:
- Scale controller monitors triggers
- Creates new instances based on predefined thresholds
- HTTP triggers: 100 concurrent requests per instance

### Cold Start:
- Delay when a new instance is initialized
- More noticeable in Consumption plans
- Reduced in Premium plans with pre-warmed instances

### Performance Optimization:
- Use async patterns in C#
- Reuse HTTP clients and other connections
- Implement singleton patterns for shared resources
- Avoid long startup code in function constructors

### 💡 Exam Tip:
> Understand scale controller behavior and how different triggers affect scaling decisions. Know how to mitigate cold starts.

### ⚠️ Gotcha:
> Functions scale differently based on trigger type. HTTP triggers scale based on request rate, while queue triggers scale based on queue length.

## 🔒 Security

### Authentication and Authorization:
- **Function-level auth**: API keys, OAuth tokens
- **Built-in Auth/Auth**: Azure AD, Microsoft accounts, etc.
- **Custom auth**: Implement custom authentication logic

### Managed Identity:
- System-assigned or user-assigned
- Access Azure resources without storing credentials
- Simplified secret management

### Secret Management:
- **Application settings**: For simple scenarios
- **Key Vault references**: `@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=...)`
- **Key Vault with Managed Identity**: Most secure approach

### Network Security:
- **VNet Integration**: Connect to resources in a VNet
- **Private Endpoints**: Expose functions privately
- **IP Restrictions**: Limit inbound traffic

### 💡 Exam Tip:
> Understand how to use managed identities with Azure Functions to access other Azure services securely without storing connection strings.

### CRON Expressions for Timer Triggers

Timer triggers in Azure Functions use CRON expressions to define schedules. Understanding CRON syntax is crucial for the AZ-204 exam.

#### CRON Format in Azure Functions:
Azure Functions uses a 6-part CRON expression:
```
{second} {minute} {hour} {day} {month} {day-of-week}
```

- **Second**: 0-59
- **Minute**: 0-59
- **Hour**: 0-23
- **Day**: 1-31
- **Month**: 1-12 or names (JAN, FEB, etc.)
- **Day-of-week**: 0-6 or names (SUN, MON, etc.) where 0 = Sunday

#### Special Characters:
- **\***: Any value (wildcard)
- **,**: Value list separator ("2,4,6")
- **-**: Range of values ("1-5")
- **\/**: Step values ("0/15" = every 15 units starting from 0)
- **?**: No specific value (only for day-of-month and day-of-week)

#### Common CRON Examples:
- `0 */5 * * * *`: Every 5 minutes
- `0 0 * * * *`: Every hour (on the hour)
- `0 0 0 * * *`: Once a day at midnight
- `0 0 9-17 * * 1-5`: Every hour from 9 AM to 5 PM, Monday to Friday
- `0 30 9 * * 1`: Every Monday at 9:30 AM
- `0 0 0 1 * *`: First day of every month at midnight
- `0 0 0 * * 0`: Every Sunday at midnight

#### Timer Trigger Configuration:
```json
{
  "schedule": "0 */5 * * * *",
  "name": "myTimer",
  "type": "timerTrigger",
  "direction": "in"
}
```

#### C# Timer Example:
```csharp
[FunctionName("TimerFunction")]
public static void Run(
    [TimerTrigger("0 */5 * * * *")] TimerInfo myTimer,
    ILogger log)
{
    log.LogInformation($"Timer function executed at: {DateTime.Now}");
}
```

#### Additional Timer Settings:
- **RunOnStartup**: Run immediately when function starts (boolean)
- **UseMonitor**: Enable timer monitoring for reliability (boolean)

#### Time Zones in Timer Triggers:
- CRON expressions are evaluated in UTC by default
- To use a different time zone:
  1. Install the `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.TimerTrigger` NuGet package
  2. Specify the time zone name in the TimerTrigger attribute:
```csharp
[TimerTrigger("0 30 9 * * *", RunOnStartup = false, UseTimeZone = true)] 
TimerInfo timer,
[TimerTriggerTimeZoneInfo("Eastern Standard Time")] TimeZoneInfo timeZone
```

#### ⚠️ Gotchas:
- The 6-part CRON format in Azure Functions is different from standard 5-part Linux CRON
- Azure Functions timer has minimum resolution of 1 minute in Consumption plan
- For sub-minute timers, use Premium or App Service plans
- Timer triggers have reduced accuracy on Consumption plan during scale-out operations

## 📊 Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Application Insights:
- Automatic integration with Azure Functions
- Log telemetry, exceptions, and dependencies
- Query logs with Kusto Query Language (KQL)

### Function Logs:
- View logs in real-time in the Azure Portal
- Configure log levels in host.json
- Stream logs locally with Azure Functions Core Tools

### Metrics:
- Execution count
- Execution time
- Error rate
- Memory usage

### Distributed Tracing:
- Trace requests across multiple services
- Visualize end-to-end transactions
- Identify bottlenecks

### 💡 Exam Tip:
> Know how to configure different logging levels in host.json and how to query function logs using Application Insights.

### ⚠️ Gotcha:
> Application Insights has its own separate cost. High volume functions can generate significant Application Insights charges if you log too verbosely.

## 🔄 Integration with Other Azure Services

### Common Integration Patterns:

#### Storage Services:
- Blob Storage: Store and retrieve files
- Table Storage: Simple NoSQL data storage
- Queue Storage: Asynchronous processing

#### Database Services:
- Cosmos DB: Global-scale NoSQL database
- SQL Database: Relational data storage
- Redis Cache: In-memory caching

#### Messaging Services:
- Event Grid: Reactive event handling
- Event Hubs: Big data streaming
- Service Bus: Enterprise messaging

#### Other Services:
- API Management: Expose functions as managed APIs
- Logic Apps: Orchestrate complex workflows
- Durable Functions: Stateful function orchestration

### 💡 Exam Tip:
> Understand the common patterns for integrating Functions with other Azure services. Know which binding to use for each service.

### ⚠️ Gotcha:
> When using App Service Authentication with Azure Functions, it's enabled at the function app level, not the individual function level.

## 🧩 Advanced Concepts

### Durable Functions:
- Stateful workflows in a serverless environment
- Function chaining, fan-out/fan-in, async HTTP APIs
- Entity functions for state management

#### Durable Function Patterns:
1. **Function Chaining**: 
   - Execute functions in sequence
   - Output of one function becomes input to the next

2. **Fan-out/Fan-in**:
   - Execute multiple functions in parallel
   - Aggregate results

3. **Async HTTP APIs**:
   - Long-running operations via HTTP
   - Return immediate response with status endpoint

4. **Monitor Pattern**:
   - Recurring process in a workflow
   - Example: Polling until conditions met

5. **Human Interaction**:
   - Workflow with human approval steps
   - Timeouts and reminders

### Proxies:
- Route requests to multiple function apps
- Modify requests and responses
- Create mock APIs

### Custom Handlers:
- Use any language or runtime
- Communicate via HTTP interface
- Bring your own language support

### 💡 Exam Tip:
> Focus on understanding Durable Functions orchestrators, activities, and entities. Know the different patterns and when to use each one.

### ⚠️ Gotcha:
> Durable Functions orchestrator code must be deterministic. Any non-deterministic operations (like random number generation or datetime operations) should be moved to activity functions.
