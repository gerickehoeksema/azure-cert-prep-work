## üß© Core Concepts

### Microsoft Entra ID Overview

- **Definition**: Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based identity and access management service
- **Functions**:
    - Authenticates users and applications
    - Manages access to resources
    - Provides single sign-on (SSO) capabilities
    - Integrates with other Microsoft services

### Key Terminology

- **Tenant**: An instance of Entra ID representing an organization
- **Directory**: Repository of identity data for a tenant
- **User Principal**: Human identity within Entra ID
- **Service Principal**: Identity for an application or service
- **Application Object**: Global definition of an app in Entra ID
- **Tokens**:
    - **ID Token**: Contains claims about user authentication
    - **Access Token**: Grants access to protected resources
    - **Refresh Token**: Used to obtain new access tokens

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Exam Tip**: Know the difference between ID tokens, access tokens, and refresh tokens as the exam frequently tests this knowledge.

## üîÑ Authentication Flows

### OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow

1. User initiates sign-in
2. App redirects to Microsoft identity platform
3. User authenticates and consents
4. Platform returns authorization code
5. App exchanges code for tokens
6. Tokens are used to access resources

```csharp
// C# example using MSAL for authorization code flow
var app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder
    .Create(clientId)
    .WithAuthority(AzureCloudInstance.AzurePublic, tenantId)
    .WithRedirectUri("http://localhost")
    .Build();

var result = await app.AcquireTokenInteractive(scopes)
    .ExecuteAsync();
```

### OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Flow (App-only)

1. App authenticates directly with identity platform
2. App receives token without user interaction
3. App uses token to access resources

```csharp
// C# example using MSAL for client credentials flow
var app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder
    .Create(clientId)
    .WithClientSecret(clientSecret)
    .WithAuthority(new Uri($"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}"))
    .Build();

var result = await app.AcquireTokenForClient(scopes)
    .ExecuteAsync();
```

### OAuth 2.0 Implicit Flow

1. App requests token directly from authorization endpoint
2. Token returned in URL fragment
3. App extracts and uses token

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: Implicit flow is less secure and being deprecated. Prefer authorization code flow with PKCE for SPAs.

### OAuth 2.0 Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC)

1. App collects username and password
2. App sends credentials to token endpoint
3. Token returned to app

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Exam Tip**: ROPC should be used only in limited scenarios (legacy apps, automation) and is not recommended for most applications.

### On-Behalf-Of Flow

1. Service receives token from client
2. Service exchanges token for new token to access downstream APIs
3. Chain of trust established

```csharp
// C# example of On-Behalf-Of flow
var app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder
    .Create(clientId)
    .WithClientSecret(clientSecret)
    .WithAuthority(new Uri($"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}"))
    .Build();

var userAssertion = new UserAssertion(accessToken);
var result = await app.AcquireTokenOnBehalfOf(scopes, userAssertion)
    .ExecuteAsync();
```

## üìù App Registration & Service Principals

### App Registration Process

1. Register app in Azure portal (App registrations)
2. Configure authentication settings
3. Define API permissions
4. Set up credentials (certificates or secrets)
5. Configure token configuration

### Service Principals Types

- **Application**: Created when app is registered
- **Managed Identity**: System-assigned or user-assigned
- **Legacy**: Created for automation scenarios

### Application Manifest

- JSON file defining app properties
- Critical settings:
    - `appRoles`: Custom roles for access control
    - `requiredResourceAccess`: Required API permissions
    - `oauth2AllowImplicitFlow`: Enable/disable implicit flow
    - `signInAudience`: Who can use the application

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Exam Tip**: You might need to identify issues in application manifest JSON or explain what specific properties control.

## üõ°Ô∏è Managed Identities

### Types of Managed Identities

- **System-assigned**: Tied to service lifetime, automatically cleaned up
- **User-assigned**: Independent lifecycle, can be shared across services

### Supported Services

- Azure VM
- Azure App Service/Functions
- Azure Container Instances
- Azure Kubernetes Service
- Azure Logic Apps
- Azure API Management
- Azure Data Factory

### Implementation

```csharp
// C# example using DefaultAzureCredential with managed identity
var credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
var client = new SecretClient(new Uri("https://myvault.vault.azure.net/"), credential);
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Exam Tip**: Know exactly which services support managed identities and how to implement them in code. This is frequently tested.

## üöß Access Control

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Built-in roles vs. custom roles
- Scope: Management group, subscription, resource group, resource
- Assignment: User, group, service principal, managed identity

### App Roles

- Custom roles defined in app registration
- Assigned to users, groups, or service principals
- Retrieved in tokens and used for authorization

### Scopes & Permissions

- **Delegated permissions**: App acts on behalf of signed-in user
- **Application permissions**: App acts with its own identity

### Claims-Based Authorization

- Extract claims from tokens
- Make authorization decisions based on claims
- Implement in middleware

```csharp
// C# example of claims-based authorization
[Authorize(Policy = "RequireAdminRole")]
public IActionResult AdminDashboard()
{
    return View();
}

// In Startup.cs
services.AddAuthorization(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy("RequireAdminRole", policy =>
        policy.RequireClaim("roles", "admin"));
});
```

## üìö Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)

### MSAL Features

- Acquires tokens from Microsoft identity platform
- Handles token caching and renewal
- Provides consistent authentication experience
- Supports various authentication flows
- Cross-platform support

### Key MSAL Classes

- `PublicClientApplication`: For client apps (mobile, desktop)
- `ConfidentialClientApplication`: For web apps/APIs with secrets
- `IAccount`: Represents user account
- `AuthenticationResult`: Contains tokens and claims

### Implementation Patterns

```csharp
// C# example of MSAL token acquisition with error handling
try
{
    var result = await app.AcquireTokenSilent(scopes, account)
        .ExecuteAsync();
}
catch (MsalUiRequiredException)
{
    // Token cache empty or expired, interactive auth needed
    var result = await app.AcquireTokenInteractive(scopes)
        .ExecuteAsync();
}
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Exam Tip**: Understand token caching in MSAL and exception handling patterns. Exam often tests proper implementation of token acquisition.

## üîê Conditional Access

### Conditional Access Policies

- Control access based on signals:
    - User/group
    - Location/IP
    - Device state
    - Application
    - Risk detection

### Common Conditions

- Sign-in risk (AI-based detection)
- Device platform/state
- Location (trusted/untrusted)
- Client applications

### Common Controls

- Block/allow access
- Require MFA
- Require compliant device
- Require app protection policy
- Require password change

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Exam Tip**: You won't need to configure Conditional Access policies, but you should understand how they affect authentication flows and how to handle them in your code.

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Implementation

### Web App Authentication Pattern

```csharp
// C# example for ASP.NET Core web app
services.AddAuthentication(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(Configuration.GetSection("AzureAd"));

services.AddAuthorization(options =>
{
    options.FallbackPolicy = options.DefaultPolicy;
});
```

### Web API Authentication Pattern

```csharp
// C# example for ASP.NET Core Web API
services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApi(Configuration.GetSection("AzureAd"));

services.AddAuthorization();
```

### B2C Implementation

```csharp
// C# example for Azure AD B2C
services.AddAuthentication(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(options =>
    {
        Configuration.Bind("AzureAdB2C", options);
        options.ResponseType = "code";
        options.UsePkce = true;
    });
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Exam Tips & Gotchas

## üß™ Practice Questions

1. **Question**: Which authentication flow should be used for a daemon service that runs without user interaction?
    
    - **Answer**: Client Credentials Flow
2. **Question**: What is the key difference between system-assigned and user-assigned managed identities?
    
    - **Answer**: System-assigned identities are tied to the resource lifecycle and are automatically deleted when the resource is deleted. User-assigned identities have an independent lifecycle.
3. **Question**: Which class should you use in MSAL for a web API that needs to authenticate with a client secret?
    
    - **Answer**: ConfidentialClientApplication
4. **Question**: How would you implement the On-Behalf-Of flow in a microservice architecture?
    
    - **Answer**: Use the UserAssertion class with AcquireTokenOnBehalfOf method to exchange the incoming token for a new token to access downstream services.
5. **Question**: What is the correct way to handle MsalUiRequiredException in a web application?
    
    - **Answer**: Redirect the user to an interactive authentication experience since silent token acquisition failed.
